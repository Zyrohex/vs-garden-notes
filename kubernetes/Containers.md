# Containers

Containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files.

## Characteristics

*Isolation:* Containers run isolated from each other and the host system, sharing the host OS kernel, but otherwise operating in their own isolated environment.
Portability: Since containers carry all their dependencies, they can run consistently across any computing environment, from a personal laptop to a public cloud or a hybrid setup.

*Resource Efficiency:* Containers require less overhead than traditional virtual machines because they do not include operating system images. This makes them more efficient in terms of system resource usage.

## Usage in Kubernetes:

*[[Pods]]:* In Kubernetes, containers do not run directly on the host but are grouped into Pods. A Pod can contain one or several containers that share storage, network, and lifecycle (they are created and destroyed together).

*Deployment and Management:* Kubernetes provides extensive support for container management, including provisioning, networking, load-balancing, and lifecycle management facilities.

## Benefits

*Scalability and Management:* Containers' lightweight nature makes them ideal for scaling applications. Kubernetes can rapidly scale containerized applications up and down in response to demand.

*Development and Deployment:* Containers support CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) processes for rapid and reliable software development and deployment. They ensure that software runs reliably when moved from one computing environment to another.

## Common Tools

Docker is one of the most popular containerization platforms. Kubernetes itself is designed to work with any container runtime that conforms to the Container Runtime Interface (CRI), including Docker, CRI-O, and containerd.
