# Automatic Bin Packing

## **Definition:**

Automatic bin packing refers to Kubernetes' ability to automatically place containers based on their resource requirements and other constraints, while minimizing the number of running nodes to reduce costs.

## **Functionality:** 

Kubernetes checks the resource needs of containers (CPU and memory) and fits them onto nodes in a way that maximizes the utilization of resources. This is facilitated by the Kubernetes scheduler, which selects optimal nodes for each pod.

## **Benefits:** 

This feature helps in optimizing resource usage and reducing costs by ensuring that nodes are utilized effectively, reducing the need for unnecessary nodes.
